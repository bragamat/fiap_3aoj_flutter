# BetterWorkout
BetterWorkout is being developed in order to help you improve the most out of
your workout routines. Studies have shown that, in order to improve our training
sessions, we must periodize the cadence of each muscle group's stimuli keeping
track of intensity.

When you signup for BetterWorkout, you're called "Challenger". Each challenger
can have 10 workout plans at most and keep track of each workout plan
individually throughout its periodization.

## Secrets
Given that we use env vars to run our app integration with Firebase, make sure
to get all necessary secrets on `.env.example` with someone on our team!

## Getting Started

```bash
$ flutter pub get
```

```bash
$ make
```

## 1. Secrets Management ü§´
As a good practice we should never leak our secrets in our code base, thus
making us setting Environment Variables to make our firebase integration
available;
Flutter makes it easy to inject env vars from a given file or direct from the
CLI through `$ flutter run --dart-define-from-file=.env.json` and then we can
use it on our code like the example bellow:

```json FILE:.env.json
{
  "ANDROID_API_KEY": "<SOME_ANDROID_API_KEY>",
  "ANDROID_APP_ID": "<SOME_ANDROID_APP_ID>",
  "ANDROID_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID": "<SOME_ANDROID_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID>",
  "ANDROID_PROJECT_ID": "<SOME_ANDROID_PROJECT_ID>",
  "ANDROID_STORAGE_BUCKET": "<SOME_ANDROID_STORAGE_BUCKET>",
  "IOS_API_KEY": "<SOME_IOS_API_KEY>",
  "IOS_APP_ID": "<SOME_IOS_APP_KEY>",
  "IOS_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID": "<SOME_IOS_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID>",
  "IOS_PROJECT_ID": "<SOME_IOS_PROJECT_ID>",
  "IOS_STORAGE_BUCKET": "<SOME_IOS_STORAGE_BUCKET>",
  "IOS_BUNDLE_ID": "<SOME_IOS_BUNDLE_ID>"
}
```

```dart
 static const FirebaseOptions android = FirebaseOptions(
    apiKey: String.fromEnvironment('ANDROID_API_KEY'),
    appId: String.fromEnvironment('ANDROID_APP_ID'),
    messagingSenderId: String.fromEnvironment('ANDROID_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID'),
    projectId: String.fromEnvironment('ANDROID_PROJECT_ID'),
    storageBucket: String.fromEnvironment('ANDROID_STORAGE_BUCKET'),
  );

  static const FirebaseOptions ios = FirebaseOptions(
    apiKey: String.fromEnvironment('IOS_API_KEY'),
    appId: String.fromEnvironment('IOS_APP_ID'),
    messagingSenderId: String.fromEnvironment('IOS_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID'),
    projectId: String.fromEnvironment('IOS_PROJECT_ID'),
    storageBucket: String.fromEnvironment('IOS_STORAGE_BUCKET'),
    iosBundleId: String.fromEnvironment('IOS_BUNDLE_ID'),
  );
```
